The print command sets up a job for printing file_name.
The specified file name must have an extension that identifies it as one of the
file types that have previously been declared with the type command.
If optional printer names are specified, then these printers must previously
have been declared using the printer command, and they define the set of
eligible printers for this job.  Only a printer in the set of eligible printers
for a job should be used for printing that jobs.  Moreover, an eligible printer
can only be used to print a job if there is a way to convert the file in the
job to the type that can be printed by that printer.
If no printer name is specified in the print command, then any declared
printer is an eligible printer.
